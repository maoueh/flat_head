## Goals

Our goal is to provide The Graph's Indexers the tools to trustlessly share flat files with cryptographic guarantees 
that the data in the flat files is part of the canonical history of the Ethereum blockchain, 
enabling Indexers to quickly sync all historical data and begin serving data with minimal effort.
